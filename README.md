# Simple Frontend Template

This is a minimal template for a normalized CSS frontend project, powered by:
- [Shoelace (v2.14.0)](https://shoelace.style/),
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), 
- and [Material Icons (v4.0.0)](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

## Prerequisite

Please make sure you have [SASS installed](https://sass-lang.com/install/) to compile the SCSS files.
Otherwise, feel free to remove the SCSS files and use vanilla CSS instead.
